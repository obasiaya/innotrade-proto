# InnoTrade Protocol

**InnoTrade Protocol** is a decentralized holdings system built on Clarity that enables secure, time-locked, and multi-party verified digital resource reservations. The protocol introduces layered authorization, dispute resolution, resource recovery, and third-party verification to ensure trust, transparency, and control in asset reservations.

## 🌐 Overview

The protocol supports:
- Authenticated allocations with anti-Sybil protections
- Multi-party approval mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Tiered authorization based on resource value
- Reservation quarantine and dispute resolution
- Time-locked recovery and secure resource reclamation
- Third-party verification and compliance checks

## 📦 Features

- **Decentralized Ledger:** Transparent state tracking of reservations
- **Role-Based Access:** Overseer and originator-controlled operations
- **Timed Validity:** Lifespan limits and block-based time windows
- **Event Logging:** All critical actions are traceable via on-chain logs
- **Security Layers:** Identity proofing, time delays, and authorization tiers
